# Ninja Game

A small WIP Slick2D game with basic functionality, built on LWJGL. It's now playable and currently has one completable level.

I will be adding a level 2 soon once I can find a cool spritesheet to rip off the internet somewhere ~ but also thinking about creating my own character spritesheet over Christmas which would be very fun.

To play the game, clone this repo locally and open the project in an IDE (I used IntelliJ but can be played in Eclipse etc).

Note: Slick2D has a bug around adding music and sound effects as a part of the project itself, so you won't be able to hear the super cool sound effects from the game which is sad, but you can just imagine it I guess.

Thanks!
