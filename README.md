# Ninja Game

A small WIP Slick2D game with basic functionality, built on LWJGL. It's now playable and currently has one completable level.

I will be creating further levels for the game in the future.

To play, clone this repo locally and open the project in an IDE (I used IntelliJ but can be played in Eclipse etc).

Enjoy!
